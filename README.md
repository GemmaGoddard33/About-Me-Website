# My First HTML and CSS Project: Portfolio Website

This project is my **first HTML and CSS website**, built as part of a class assignment to create a personal portfolio. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and achievements in a clean and visually appealing format.


## About the Project

The goal of this project was to design and develop a simple portfolio website using **HTML** and **CSS**. This website reflects my personal style while highlighting my projects, skills, and interests at the time. When building this project I thought that I wanted to go into UX design, however, the remainder of this class made me fall in love with software engineering.


## Highlights

This project was part of a **department-wide competition** for the **best portfolio website**, judged by the computer science faculty. I am proud to share that my website **won first place** in the competition! ðŸŽ‰
